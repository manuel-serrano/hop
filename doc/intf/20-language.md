Language definition
===================

A Hop.js language is a DSL or a complete language that can be used to
implement an whole module content or a function body. There are two
possibility for using a module MOD implemented in a language LANG.

  1. When MOD is required, LANG is passed as a second argument to
 `require`. See chapter [HopScript modules](01-module.html). for details
 on module importations.
  2. The MOD header contains a `"use LANG"` declaration.
 This second form is possible only when the LANG is an extension of JavaScript,
 that is to be parsed by the Hop compiler parser.


Language implementation
=======================

A language is any JavaScript object that implements a compilation
function associated with the `Symbol.compiler` property. This function
accepts two parameters, a resolved name of file to be compiled, and an
optional `options` object. If the `options` is undefined or if the
`options.target` property is undefined, it is to the compiler to
decide where and how to communicate its result to the Hop runtime
system. A compilation result must be an object with two properties:

  * `type`: the type of the result which can either be:
    * `filename`: denoting that the compilation result as been stored in
 a file;
    * `json`: denoting that the compilation result is a json;
    * `ast`: denoting that the compilation result is an internal form, directly
 suitable to the Hop compiler;
    * `value`: denoting that the compilation result is an arbitrary
 JavaScript value convertible into json;
    * `error`: denoting a compilation failure.
  * `value`: the actual value of the compilation.

For instance, if the language compiler wants to communicate that its
result is store into a file, it should return a JavaScript object like:

```
{ type: "filename", value: "/tmp/foo.tmp/js" }
```


When the compiler is to decide the file name where to store its result,
it might make sense for it to use the standard Hop cache directory, whose
name might be obtained with:

```
require( hop.config ).cacheDir
```


#### Example ####

${ doc.include( doc.EXAMPLES_DIR + "/lang/README.md" ) }

Let's start with a sample csv file.

${ <span class="label label-info">lang/sample.csv</span> }
```
${ doc.include( doc.EXAMPLES_DIR + "/lang/sample.csv" ) }
```

The client file requires the `sample.csv` file as if it was a regular
Hop.js module, but it specifies that this module is implemented in the
`csvg.js` language.

${ <span class="label label-info">lang/lang.js</span> }
```hopscript
${ doc.include( doc.EXAMPLES_DIR + "/lang/lang.js", 14 ) }
```

The `csv.js` language is implemented as follows:

${ <span class="label label-info">lang/csv.js</span> }
```hopscript
${ doc.include( doc.EXAMPLES_DIR + "/lang/csv.js", 14 ) }
```

The JavaScript language is a mere wrapper of the native Hop csv parser
that is implemented as:

${ <span class="label label-info">lang/csv.hop</span> }
```hop
${ doc.include( doc.EXAMPLES_DIR + "/lang/csv.hop", 15 ) }
```


Hopc parser plugins
===================

The hopc parser can be extended with _plugins_ that can be used to extend
the syntax it analyses. This feature is still experimental and will be
described when stabiliez. In the meantime, an example can be found in
the implementation of the HipHop language.


Require extension
=================

Hop extends the `require` form as follows:

```ebnf
<require> -->
  require( <ModuleExpr> )
  | require( <ModuleExpr>, <LangExpr> )
  | require( <ModuleExpr>, <LangExpr>, <CompLangExpr> )
```

The first form is the original `require` form. The second, loads 
`ModuleExpr` defined in language `LangExpr`. The third, loads
`ModuleExpr` defined in language `LangExpr`, passing `CompLangexpr`
to the `LangExpr` compiler.
